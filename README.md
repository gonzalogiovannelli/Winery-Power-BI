## ðŸ“Š Key DAX Measures  
This section includes the most relevant **DAX calculations** used in this Power BI dashboard.  

### ðŸ”¹ Bank Account Balances  
Calculates the total balance for different bank accounts.  
```DAX
VAR CAJAACTUAL = "Bank Account 1"
RETURN
    CALCULATE(SUM(Cobros[Importe AR$]), Cobros[Caja] = CAJAACTUAL) +
    CALCULATE(SUM(Vinoteca[Total]), Vinoteca[Caja] = CAJAACTUAL) -
    CALCULATE(SUM(Pagos[Importe AR$]), Pagos[Caja] = CAJAACTUAL) +
    CALCULATE(SUM('Arqueo de Cajas'[Importe AR$]), 'Arqueo de Cajas'[Destino] = CAJAACTUAL) -
    CALCULATE(SUM('Arqueo de Cajas'[Importe AR$]), 'Arqueo de Cajas'[Origen] = CAJAACTUAL)
```

### ðŸ”¹ ASSETS USD  
Calculates the total assets in USD, converting AR$ balances at the exchange rate.  
```DAX
ASSETS USD = 
    ([Bank Account 1 AR$] + 
     [Bank Account 2 AR$] + 
     [Bank Account 3 AR$] + 
     [Checks AR$] + 
     [AR$ Wine Stock]) / [Exchange Rate] + 
     [Bank Account 1 USD] + 
     [Bank Account 2 USD]
```

### ðŸ”¹ Total Supplier Debt  
Computes the outstanding payments to suppliers.  
```DAX
Total Supplier Debt = SUM(Proveedores[Debt])
```

### ðŸ”¹ Net Profit Calculation  
Calculates the **profit after deducting expenses**.  
```DAX
Net Profit = [Total Sales] - SUM(Pagos[Total Expenses])
```

### ðŸ”¹ Exchange Rate Conversion  
Converts local currency into USD using the latest exchange rate.  
```DAX
Sales in USD = SUM(Ventas[Revenue]) / SELECTEDVALUE(Tipo_Cambio[ExchangeRate])
```

### ðŸ”¹ Units Sold Winery  
Calculates the total number of wine bottles sold in the winery.  
```DAX
Units Sold Winery = CALCULATE(SUM(Vinoteca[Cantidad]), Vinoteca[Categoria] = "Wines")
```

### ðŸ”¹ Units Purchased Wines  
Calculates the total number of wine bottles purchased.  
```DAX
Units Purchased Wines = CALCULATE(SUM('Wine Records'[Net Quantity]), 'Wine List'[Category] = "Wines")
```

### ðŸ”¹ Units Stock Wines  
Calculates the total stock of wine bottles available.  
```DAX
Units Stock Wines = [Units Purchased Wines] - [Units Sold Winery] - [Units Sold Restaurant]
```

### ðŸ”¹ AR$ Wine Stock  
Calculates the total valuation of wine stock in AR$.  
```DAX
AR$ Wine Stock = SUMX('Wine List', 'Wine List'[Final Cost] * [Units Stock Wines])
```

ðŸ“Œ These **DAX calculations enhance financial analysis and enable advanced reporting** in Power BI.
